# FORESIGHT


**THE REAL-TIME PREDICTION MARKET**

By leveraging blockchain technology, Foresight ensures **fairness, transparency, and tokenized rewards** for accurate predictions.

## The Problem FORESIGHT Solves

Most existing prediction markets face two main issues:
* Decentralized but unusable – Platforms on chains like Ethereum are slow and expensive, making them impractical for everyday users.
* Centralized but unfair – Faster platforms are controlled by central authorities, leading to bias, censorship, and lack of transparency.
FORESIGHT solves this by combining true decentralization with speed, low fees, and fairness, giving users full control over their predictions across multiple sectors.
